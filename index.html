            <h2>Community Development</h2>
            <p>
                I have actively participated in community development initiatives, focusing on sanitation and health awareness. One of my notable projects involved leading an outreach program where I collaborated with local teams to educate the community about the importance of cleanliness and proper waste disposal.
                Through this initiative, we were able to engage with various stakeholders, including schools and market vendors, to create a cleaner and healthier environment. My commitment to community service has significantly shaped my perspective on the impact of collective efforts in addressing local challenges.

            <p>
                My journey in web development has been both challenging and rewarding. I started by learning HTML and CSS, which sparked my interest in creating visually appealing and functional websites. As I progressed, I embraced JavaScript and various frameworks that allowed me to enhance user experiences through interactive elements.
                I have developed several projects that showcase my skills, including:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://estherusoro.github.io/Omega-care-website/#about">Website 1: Omega Care Website</a></li>

                </ul>
                I am always eager to learn new technologies and trends, with the goal of continuously improving my craft.
